Creating multi project build with scala is a bit trickier.
Keep in mind following caveats.

    - Changing build.sbt
        - Creating dependencies Seq and adding your dependencies in it.
        - Add the projects
            - By right clicking project(SparkEPLAnalysis) in Intellij and add module (FootBall, BaseBall)
            - Add val FootBall and BaseBall project in build.sbt, provide the location and dependencies at least
        - Create a global project and aggregate all of your project

    - Surprisingly the project structure src/main/scala/ does not get created in FootBall and BaseBall
    - Just create the directory main/scala, test/scala in src and then you can create packages

    - Notes On assembly
        - Inside project add assembly.sbt file with following content
            addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.9")
        - In build.sbt add following content (Reasoning about it is in notes)
            val meta = """META.INF(.)*""".r
            assemblyMergeStrategy in assembly := {
              case PathList("javax", "servlet", xs @ _*)         => MergeStrategy.first
              case PathList(ps @ _*) if ps.last endsWith ".html" => MergeStrategy.first
              case "application.conf"                            => MergeStrategy.concat
              case "unwanted.txt"                                => MergeStrategy.discard
              case x =>
                val oldStrategy = (assemblyMergeStrategy in assembly).value
                oldStrategy(x)
            }

    - Notes about How to run
        - On cmd do sbt
        - project BaseBall
            run
        - project FootBall
            run
